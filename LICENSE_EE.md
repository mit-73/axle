Copyright (c) 2026 ApeironFoundation

## Terms

With regard to the Axle Software files and directories that contain ".ee."
in their filename or ".ee" in their directory path (the "Enterprise Software"):

### Production Use

The Enterprise Software may only be used in production if you (and any entity that
you represent) hold a valid [Project Name] Enterprise License agreement. The scope
of permitted usage — including but not limited to the number of users, instances,
environments, or other metrics — is defined in your individual Enterprise License
agreement with ApeironFoundation. Use that exceeds the scope defined in your Enterprise
License agreement is not permitted.

To obtain an Enterprise License, contact ApeironFoundation at [mit-73](https://mit-73.github.io/).

### Development and Testing

You may copy and modify the Enterprise Software for development, testing, and
evaluation purposes only, without requiring an Enterprise License, provided that:
(a) such use does not involve production data or production workloads;
(b) such use is limited to evaluation, development, and testing environments;
(c) such use does not provide any functionality to end users or third parties;
(d) evaluation use does not exceed 90 days from first use; continued evaluation
    beyond 90 days requires written permission from ApeironFoundation.

### Modifications

You are free to modify the Enterprise Software and publish patches to it, subject to
the following conditions:
(a) all modifications and patches may only be used, copied, modified, distributed,
    or otherwise exploited in conjunction with a valid Axle Enterprise
    License for the corresponding usage;
(b) by submitting modifications or patches to the official Axle repository,
    you agree to the terms of the Contributor License Agreement [CLA.md](CLA.md), which
    grants ApeironFoundation the right to license such contributions under any terms;
(c) modifications that are not submitted to the official repository remain your
    intellectual property, but may only be used in compliance with this license.

### Restrictions

Unless you hold a valid Enterprise License, it is forbidden to:
(a) use the Enterprise Software in production;
(b) copy, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell the Enterprise Software;
(c) provide the Enterprise Software to third parties as a hosted or managed service,
    including but not limited to SaaS, PaaS, or any similar online service;
(d) use the Enterprise Software to create, maintain, or distribute a product or
    service that competes with, or serves as a substitute for, the Axle
    software or any product or service offered by the licensor;
(e) remove, alter, or obscure any licensing, copyright, or other notices.

Even if you hold a valid Enterprise License, the following remain prohibited unless
explicitly granted in your Enterprise License agreement:
(a) redistribution of the Enterprise Software to third parties;
(b) offering the Enterprise Software as a hosted or managed service;
(c) sublicensing the Enterprise Software;
(d) creating competing products based on the Enterprise Software.

### Termination

Your right to use the Enterprise Software terminates automatically if:
(a) you breach any of the terms of this license;
(b) your Enterprise License agreement expires without renewal.

If ApeironFoundation provides you with notice of your violation, and you cure the violation
within 30 days, your rights will be reinstated. A second violation will cause
permanent termination.

Upon termination, you must:
(a) cease all use of the Enterprise Software in production;
(b) destroy all copies of the Enterprise Software in your possession, except for
    copies needed for development and testing purposes as permitted above.
