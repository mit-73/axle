## Branding

The name **"Axle"** as used in connection with this specific
software project, the Axle logo, visual identity, and all
related branding (collectively, the "Project Branding") are associated
exclusively with the official Axle project maintained by
ApeironFoundation.

While the licensor does not claim exclusive rights to the word(s)
"Axle" in all contexts, the licensor does claim rights to
the use of "Axle" specifically in connection with software
that provides similar or related functionality to this project.

## What You May NOT Do

1. **No use in product names.** You may not use the Project Branding
   in the name of any software product, service, project, or fork
   that could be confused with the official Axle project,
   including but not limited to domain names, social media accounts,
   package registry names, or container image names.

2. **No modified logos.** You may not modify, distort, or alter the
   Axle logo or visual identity in any way.

3. **No implied endorsement.** You may not use the Project Branding
   in any way that implies endorsement, sponsorship, or affiliation
   with ApeironFoundation without explicit written permission.

4. **No use in competing products.** You may not use the Project
   Branding in connection with any product or service that competes
   with Axle.

## What You MAY Do

1. **Truthful references.** You may use the name "Axle"
   in truthful, descriptive statements about your relationship with
   the software, such as:
   - "Built with Axle"
   - "Compatible with Axle"
   - "Based on Axle" (for permitted derivative works)
   - "Unofficial fork of Axle"

2. **Community use.** You may use the name "Axle" in
   community discussions, blog posts, tutorials, and other
   educational or informational content, provided you do not imply
   official endorsement.

3. **Attribution.** You may display the Axle name for the
   purpose of providing required attribution under the license.

## Derivative Works

If you create a permitted fork or derivative work of Axle,
you **must**:

1. Choose a **distinct name** that is not confusingly similar to "Axle".
2. Use your own **distinct logo and visual identity**.
3. Include a **prominent notice** stating that your project is
   derived from Axle and is not affiliated with or
   endorsed by ApeironFoundation.

## Enforcement

ApeironFoundation reserves the right to request that any use of the Project
Branding that causes confusion or misrepresentation be ceased.
Failure to comply may result in legal action to the extent permitted
by applicable law.
